# Another ToDo App

## 💡 Concept
This web app is made with React, with css modules and Redux Toolkit as state management. The idea is to use OOP and allow control of the state and UI through web browser console (deliberately and intentionally using unsafe methods and mixing OOP with functional React for sake of practice) to manage tasks.


## 📦 Tech stack:
- TypeScript
- Framework: React.js (Vite setup)
- Styles: CSS modules
